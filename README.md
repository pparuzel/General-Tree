# General-Tree

## General Tree Data Structure

This coding project is to demonstrate the use of modern C++ standard  
as well as unit tests in implementation and verification of **GENERAL TREE**.  

Example of use:  
![maincpp_example](https://i.imgur.com/R1I99j9.png)

Which outputs (possibly):  
```
Empty container
P, K, P, N, H, U, P, O, O, A, 
Highest value element: U
```

The data structure has been tested by implementing **CppUnit** test cases.  
**Doxygen** tool has generated the documentation relying on the configuration file  
and multi-line comments.
