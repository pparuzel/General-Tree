# General-Tree

## General Tree Data Structure

This coding project is to demonstrate the use of modern C++ standard </br>
as well as unit tests in implementation and verification of **GENERAL TREE**.</br>

Example of use:</br>
![maincpp_example](https://i.imgur.com/R1I99j9.png)

Which outputs (possibly):</br>
```
Empty container
P, K, P, N, H, U, P, O, O, A, 
Highest value element: U
```

The data structure has been tested by implementing **CppUnit** test cases.</br>
**Doxygen** tool has generated the documentation relying on the configuration file</br>
and multi-line comments.
